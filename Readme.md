# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is called Higher Lower Game.

It's a smaller and simplest version of the original Higher Lower Game that is available on the internet.

In this project we'll be working with Instagram follower numbers, instead of monthly searches. You can add more data to the game if you want, just go to game_data.py and add another data following the previous ones.

# PLAYING THE GAME

When playing the game, you will have to choose between A and B, respectively, Higher or Lower. If you chose the right answer, you'll gain one point and the game will proceed; Else, you'll lose.
